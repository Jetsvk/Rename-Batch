- Function: Loops through all .mkv files in the current directory that start with [Koenime].
  
2. If you want to rename all .mkv files in the current directory.
   - ```bash
     for %%f in ("*.mkv") do (
- Function: Loops through all .mkv files in the current directory.

### 🛠️ How this work
This batch script automatically renames `.mkv` video files by removing unwanted patterns from their filenames. Here’s a quick overview of what happens:

1. **File Selection**  
   The script targets video files in the current folder—specifically those starting with `[Koenime]` and ending in `.mkv`.

2. **Filename Cleanup**  
   It removes specific parts of the filename, such as `[Koenime] GTM - ` and `(480p)`, to make them cleaner and more readable.

3. **Renaming Process**  
   Each file is renamed in place using the new, cleaned-up filename. For example:
- ```bash
  Before: [Koenime] GTM - 077 (480p).mkv After : 077.mkv
  
4. **Optional Customization**  
   You can modify the script’s logic by editing this line:
```batch
 call set "new=%%old:[Koenime] GTM - =%%"
